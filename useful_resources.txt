Before we dive into the project, we should probably familiarize ourselves with Git, React, NodeJS, and PosgreSQL.

Here are some tutorials I found helpful:

Git: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org

React: We did React in assignment 3

NodeJS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb3Qk8SG5Ms&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jsz4LDYc6kv3ymONOKxwBU&ab_channel=NetNinja

PosgreSQL: TBD

Setting up the environment for our project: TBD
